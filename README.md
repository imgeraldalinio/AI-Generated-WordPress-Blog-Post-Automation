## Overview

This project is designed to streamline the process of generating technical blog posts using AI-powered content generation. It includes a Python script that interacts with OpenAI's GPT-4 model to create high-quality, informative, and undetectable blog posts. The script can be configured with various options and deployed in your CI/CD pipeline for automatic content generation.

## Prerequisites

Before you get started, ensure you have the following in place:

- **OpenAI API Key**: You need an API key to interact with the GPT-4 model. Get your API key from [OpenAI](https://beta.openai.com/signup/).
- **WordPress Site**: You should have a WordPress site with XML-RPC enabled. Ensure you have the site URL, username, and password.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/imgeraldalinio/AI-Generated-WordPress-Blog-Post-Automation.git
    cd AI-Generated-WordPress-Blog-Post-Automation
    ```
2. Install the required Python libraries:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    This command will install all the required libraries listed in the `requirements.txt` file.

3. Create a `.env` file in the project root directory and set your environment variables:
    ```ini
    OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
    WORDPRESS_SITE_URL=https://example.com/xmlrpc.php
    WORDPRESS_USERNAME=your_wordpress_username
    WORDPRESS_PASSWORD=your_wordpress_password
    MAX_TOKENS=400
    ```

4. Run the script to generate and publish your blog posts.

## Usage

- Customize your post title, categories, and tags by editing the `post_title`, `post_categories`, and `post_tags` variables in the script.
- Adjust the `max_tokens` value to control the length of generated content.
- Modify the template format in the `generate_content` function to match your desired blog post structure.
- Ensure your WordPress post settings align with the template format.

Run the script to create draft posts on your WordPress site. You can then review and publish them manually:
    ```bash
    python generate-blog-post.py
    ```
